## Overview

This script implements an advanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) agent designed as a modular "Pipe" for the OpenWebUI platform. It takes user input text and iteratively explores, refines, and evaluates diverse analytical perspectives on that text using a Large Language Model (LLM). The agent aims to discover deeper insights, novel interpretations, and well-developed analyses by simulating a structured thought process.

The agent can operate using traditional MCTS scoring or leverage Bayesian inference (Beta distribution) for more nuanced evaluation and exploration, particularly with Thompson Sampling.

## Key Features

*   **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** Systematically explores a tree of possible analyses.
*   **LLM-Driven Exploration:** Uses an LLM for:
    *   Generating an initial analysis.
    *   Proposing critiques, alternative directions, or novel connections ("thoughts").
    *   Revising analyses based on these thoughts.
    *   Evaluating the quality and insightfulness of generated analyses (scoring 1-10).
    *   Generating concise keyword tags for analyses.
    *   Synthesizing the final conclusions from the best path.
*   **Bayesian Evaluation (Optional):** Models node value using Beta distributions (alpha, beta parameters), updated with evaluation scores.
*   **Thompson Sampling (Optional):** If Bayesian evaluation is active, allows selecting nodes based on sampling from their Beta distributions, offering a sophisticated exploration strategy.
*   **UCT Selection:** Uses the Upper Confidence bound applied to Trees (UCT) algorithm (if not using Thompson Sampling) to balance exploring new paths vs. exploiting known good paths. Includes bonuses for:
    *   **Surprise:** Nodes deemed novel based on semantic distance, shifts in philosophical approach, or rarity of the approach.
    *   **Diversity:** Encourages exploring analyses that differ from their siblings.
*   **Context-Aware Prompts:** Provides rich context to the LLM during generation and evaluation, including the original question, the best analysis found so far, sibling node approaches, explored thought types, and high-scoring examples.
*   **Approach Classification & Tracking:** Classifies generated "thoughts" into categories (e.g., empirical, analytical, critical) and tracks their performance.
*   **Surprise Detection:** Identifies potentially interesting nodes based on semantic distance from the parent, significant shifts in approach family, and the novelty of the approach within the tree.
*   **Configurable Parameters:** Many aspects of the search (iterations, exploration weight, Bayesian priors, surprise thresholds, etc.) are configurable via OpenWebUI "Valves".
*   **Live Updates & Summaries:**
    *   Provides **Iteration Summaries** in the chat after each batch of simulations, showing progress and the current best score.
    *   Optionally shows detailed **per-simulation** steps (selection, thought, expansion, score) in the chat for transparency.
*   **Detailed Final Report:** Generates a comprehensive summary including:
    *   The full text of the best analysis found and its score.
    *   A list of the top-performing nodes with their scores, tags, and the **full driving thought** that led to them.
    *   The most explored path through the analysis tree.
    *   Highlights of any "surprising" nodes discovered.
    *   Performance statistics for different thought approaches.
    *   The configuration parameters used for the run.
*   **Final Synthesis:** Concludes with an LLM-generated synthesis that summarizes the journey of ideas along the best analysis path.
*   **Strict Prompting:** Uses carefully crafted prompts with `<instruction>` tags to guide the LLM towards desired output formats and avoid conversational filler.

## How It Works: Process Flow

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   The `Pipe` receives the user's input text via OpenWebUI.
    *   User-defined configuration (`Valves`) is applied.
    *   The LLM generates an initial analysis of the input text.
    *   The `MCTS` algorithm is initialized with this analysis as the `root` node of the search tree.

2.  **MCTS Iteration Loop:** (Repeats for `max_iterations` or until early stopping)
    *   An iteration consists of `simulations_per_iteration` cycles.
    *   **For each simulation:**
        *   **Selection:** Starting from the root, traverse the tree using UCT or Thompson Sampling to select a promising node (`leaf`). Priority is given to nodes with unvisited children.
        *   **Expansion:** If the `leaf` node isn't fully expanded, call the LLM to:
            *   Generate a `thought` (critique/suggestion) based on the `leaf` node's content and the broader search context.
            *   Update the `leaf` node's analysis based on the `thought`.
            *   Generate `tags` for the new analysis.
            *   Check for `surprise`.
            *   Create a `new_child` node containing the revised analysis, thought, tags, etc.
        *   **Simulation:** Call the LLM to evaluate the quality (score 1-10) of the node chosen for simulation (either the `new_child` or the `leaf` if expansion didn't occur).
        *   **Backpropagation:** Update the `visits` and score (`value` or `alpha`/`beta`) for all nodes on the path from the simulated node back to the root.
        *   **(Optional) Live Simulation Output:** If enabled, send details of this simulation (selection, thought, expansion, score) to the chat.
    *   **End of Iteration:** Post an **Iteration Summary** message to the chat showing the current best score and progress.
    *   **Early Stopping Check:** Terminate the loop if the best analysis has consistently met the score threshold and stability criteria.

3.  **Finalization:**
    *   The MCTS loop completes.
    *   The `Pipe` generates and sends the detailed **Final Report** (best analysis, top nodes/thoughts, path, etc.) to the chat.
    *   The `Pipe` calls the LLM one last time to generate a **Final Synthesis** based on the development path of the best analysis and sends it to the chat.
    *   The text of the best analysis found is returned as the primary output to OpenWebUI.

## Core Components

*   **`Node`:** Represents a state (an analysis) in the search tree. Stores content, the thought that led to it, scores (Bayesian or traditional), visit counts, tags, surprise status, and parent/child links.
*   **`MCTS`:** Implements the core search logic – selection, expansion, simulation, backpropagation, state tracking (best score, history), and final report generation.
*   **`Pipe`:** The interface layer for OpenWebUI. Handles requests, manages configuration (`Valves`), orchestrates the overall flow (initial analysis, MCTS loop, final synthesis), abstracts LLM interactions, and sends status/results back to the UI.

## LLM Interaction Points

The script relies heavily on the configured LLM for various cognitive tasks:

*   **Initial Analysis:** Generating the starting point (root node) from the user's raw input.
*   **Thought Generation:** Proposing critiques, alternative interpretations, or new directions based on an existing analysis node.
*   **Analysis Update:** Revising an existing analysis to incorporate a new `thought`.
*   **Evaluation (Scoring):** Assessing the intellectual quality, depth, novelty, and relevance of an analysis (1-10 score).
*   **Tag Generation:** Creating 1-3 relevant keyword tags for an analysis.
*   **Question Summarization:** Creating a concise summary of the original input for context.
*   **Final Synthesis:** Summarizing the progression of ideas along the best-found analysis path into a concluding statement.

## Configuration

The agent's behavior can be significantly customized through the `Valves` settings in the OpenWebUI interface. Key parameters include:

*   `MAX_ITERATIONS`: Total number of MCTS iterations.
*   `SIMULATIONS_PER_ITERATION`: Number of select-expand-simulate-backpropagate cycles per iteration.
*   `MAX_CHILDREN`: Maximum branches allowed from any single analysis node.
*   `EXPLORATION_WEIGHT`: UCT parameter balancing exploration/exploitation.
*   `USE_BAYESIAN_EVALUATION`: Toggle between Bayesian (Beta distribution) and traditional averaging for scores.
*   `USE_THOMPSON_SAMPLING`: Use Thompson Sampling for selection (requires Bayesian).
*   `BETA_PRIOR_ALPHA`/`BETA_PRIOR_BETA`: Initial belief parameters for Bayesian scoring.
*   `SURPRISE_*`: Thresholds and weights controlling surprise detection.
*   `EARLY_STOPPING*`: Parameters to stop the search early if a high-quality solution is found consistently.
*   `SHOW_SIMULATION_DETAILS`: Toggle verbose per-simulation output in the chat (Iteration Summaries are always shown).
*   `DEBUG_LOGGING`: Enable verbose logging to the console/log file.

## Output

*   **Live View (Chat):**
    *   Initial analysis.
    *   **Iteration Summaries:** Posted after each iteration block.
    *   **(Optional)** Per-simulation details (selection, thought, expansion, score).
*   **Final Output (Chat):**
    *   **Final MCTS Summary:** A detailed report including the best analysis text, top nodes with full thoughts, search path, surprise elements, approach stats, and parameters.
    *   **Final Synthesis:** A concluding paragraph summarizing the thought process.
*   **Return Value:** The raw text of the single best analysis found.

## Requirements (Pre-installed in openweb-ui- so just what is in it)

*   Python 3.x
*   OpenWebUI
*   FastAPI
*   NumPy
*   SciPy
*   Pydantic
*   **Optional:** `scikit-learn` (for improved semantic distance calculation and text summarization; falls back to simpler methods if unavailable).

## Usage

Integrate this script as a "Pipe" within an OpenWebUI instance. (Go to the user name in the bottom left, select admin then select functions at the top, select the function) Select the pipe model version in the models dropdown (e.g., "advanced_mcts (your_model_name)") when interacting with a model. Configure parameters using the "Valves" options in the chat settings.

## Example output- still a bit glitchy and erases the first part- working on it!

The text presents a fascinating exploration of how we understand knowledge and, crucially, how that understanding should inform ethical design. It centers around a fundamental tension: the conflict between subjective experience – what it *feels* like to perceive something, often referred to as “qualia” – and objective logic, the kind of reasoning we use to analyze the world. However, a more productive approach recognizes that these domains aren’t necessarily in conflict, but rather represent distinct yet complementary aspects of a single, embodied reality. Crucially, objective systems themselves generate subjective experiences through feedback loops and emergent properties, a dynamic process at the heart of systems theory and cybernetics. The “explainability + rational reworking” AI mode can be understood as an attempt to model this process – continually refining ethical frameworks through transparency and logical analysis, acknowledging that subjective experiences provide vital data points while objective reasoning offers the tools to interpret and adjust those perceptions. The underlying mechanism isn’t simply rational reworking, but a continuous, iterative cycle of observation, interpretation, and modification, echoing the feedback mechanisms observed in complex adaptive systems. This doesn’t involve imposing a purely rational ethics, but cultivating a dynamic understanding, one that integrates the richness of experience with the rigor of logical deduction – a process constantly shaped by the interactions within the system itself. The goal is to engineer ethical frameworks that are not static rules, but responsive and capable of adapting to the intricate, often unpredictable, feedback loops that shape human experience and, potentially, the systems with which we interact.# Advanced Bayesian MCTS v0.7.18

    Initial Expanded Analysis:
The interconnectedness of Science, Technology, Philosophy, Arts, Politics, Business, Health, Sports, Entertainment, and Education demands a shift away from treating these fields as isolated domains. A systems-theoretic approach reveals that each significantly contributes to, and is profoundly shaped by, emergent properties and complex feedback loops within broader human systems. Technological advancements, for instance, aren’t simply neutral tools; they trigger philosophical debates about ethics and human agency, impacting artistic expression, influencing political discourse and economic models, affecting health outcomes through behavioral change, shaping competitive landscapes in sports, driving trends in entertainment, and ultimately impacting educational curricula and methods. Conversely, philosophical frameworks inform the development of technology, influence the ethical considerations surrounding its use, and provide context for artistic interpretation. The dynamics of business are inextricably linked to political policy, which in turn affects public health and consumer behavior, influencing entertainment consumption and shaping educational priorities. Recognizing these reciprocal relationships—the way a scientific discovery can spark a new philosophical inquiry, or how a dominant aesthetic movement in the arts impacts sporting culture— reveals a profoundly interconnected landscape, one where systemic shifts produce entirely novel phenomena. Further investigation requires a granular exploration of specific feedback loops – for example, the impact of social media (technology) on political polarization (politics) and its subsequent effect on public health perceptions (health) or the influence of entertainment narratives (entertainment) on ethical frameworks (philosophy). Ultimately, effective analysis must move beyond static categorizations and account for the dynamism of these domains as interwoven components of human systems, constantly generating and reacting to one another.

## Final Synthesis
A holistic understanding requires recognizing that science, technology, philosophy, and the other examined domains – including arts, politics, business, health, sports, entertainment, and education – are not independent silos but rather interwoven components of complex human systems. These systems generate emergent properties and operate through intricate feedback loops, necessitating a systems-based approach for genuine insight.
